# Description
This project implements a basic chatbot in Python utilizing natural language processing techniques. The chatbot can engage in conversations, answer questions based on pre-existing data, and learn new information from user inputs. It employs sentiment analysis to understand the sentiment behind user inputs and responds accordingly. The chatbot's main features include:

Loading and saving data from a JSON file.
Finding the most suitable answer to a user's query based on similarity.
Analyzing the sentiment of user inputs.
Handling user inputs to provide appropriate responses or learn new information.
Running in a continuous loop until the user decides to exit.
The chatbot provides a simple yet effective demonstration of natural language understanding and conversation handling. It can be extended and customized further to suit specific use cases or integrate with other systems.

# PLCB.py is the main code for the chatbot
# knowledge_box is the json file where the data is stored after installing do update the file path in the code
